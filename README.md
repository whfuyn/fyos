# fyos

A hobbyist operating system written in Rust. 

See [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/).

I use this tutorial as a guide. Things of interest will be implemented on my own.

## Usage

```
cargo run
```

This will run the built kernel in `QEMU`.

## Features

- [x] Scrolling Console
